# Quiz-Application-With-dB-Connectivity-on-Python-Tkinter-

************************* Description ************************************
This Project is Developed by me & my friend Veerapathiramoorthy Pillai for our Second Year Python Project
It is a Quiz portal system with Register, Login, and Quiz modules. We have tried to make the backend secure by using hashing while saving sensitive information on the database.


************************* Technologies Used ******************************
- Python 3.7
- MySQL
- Tkinter Module
- hashlib
- xlrd library


************************* Instructions For Downloading ********************
- Install MySQL and MySQLdb library for Python
- Install xlrd for Python
//Use "pip install lib-name" (without quotes) or search on Youtube.
- Import "QuizDatabase.sql" using MySQL Workbench (configure the password as per your wish but you'll need to update it in .py files:: My configuration is "Username: root, Password: root")
- Run "AddQstnsToDB.py" and check the questions table if all the questions have been added
- Also change the location of the images 
- Run Quiz.py

In case of any errors/problems do comment!


********************************** NOTE **********************************
This project has been created right from scratch by doing a lot of research online. You are free to use it for your needs but do credit the developers
Also if you are planning to use this for your College Projects make sure you go through the code so that you can have a good understanding and you can explain it to your teachers.



Thanks!
